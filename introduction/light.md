BT: Bluetooth indicator light, flash indicates that Bluetooth is not connected; long light indicates that the base station Bluetooth and APP link are normal.

RX: The base station sends the indicator light once representing a package of CORS data to the base station. When the base station works normally, the LED should flash 1 HZ

TX: Base station receiving indicator light, flashing once represents the receipt of data from a package of onboard RTK

FIX: Base station operating status indicator, flashing significance as follows:

Continuous flash: the base station coordinates successfully, and the base station works in fixed coordinate mode

4 Flash: no positioning

3. Flash: single-point positioning

2 Flash: RTK position floating point solution, positioning accuracy submeter level

1 Flash: RTK position fixed solution, positioning accuracy cm level

P_L: Bluetooth and RTK initialization indicator flashing as follows:

Continuous flash mob: enter the spot-checking mode

2 Flash: Bluetooth initialization failed

Long bright: normal

GPS: The Sparker representative is searching for stars

RTK: not have

 RX-1: serial port 1 receive data light, is often out.

 RX-2: Serial port 2 receives the data light and has a normal 1s flash when connecting the Qianxun data.

 ANT-1:1 antenna abnormal light, is often out, often bright red means ANT 1 open circuit, often bright green means ANT 1 short circuit.

ANT-2:2 antenna abnormal lamp, is often out, often bright red means ANT 2 open circuit, often bright green means ANT 2 short circuit.
