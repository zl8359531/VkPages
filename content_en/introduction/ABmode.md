##AB dot pattern

AB mode after the user defines points A and B, automatically copy the AB route for flight. In AB mode, it supports radar imitation flight, manual obstacle avoidance, automatic radar obstacle avoidance, adjustment of AB route length during flight, manual altitude adjustment (throttle median default height flight) and nose direction.

# AB point operation process

-Re-click AB, click the clear AB point button in the APP manual operation interface to clear the last AB point information, and ensure that there is no AB point inside the aircraft (if AB point exists, the LED will have purple light flashing).
-Take off manually and fly to the first starting point. In GPS hover mode, the AB dot channel (CH 6) dial switch dials from standby to point A to record the coordinates of point A. After point A successful record, the APP will report point A successful record, and the LED light 1 violet light.
-The aircraft flies to the point B position, the water pump will automatically turn on during the flight, in the GPS hover mode AB dot channel (CH 6) dial switch from point A to point B record B point record record, LED light 2 flash light.
-After the recording is completed, the mode channel (CH 5) dial switch is switched to AB mode, and then the roll channel gives a left / right full bar action, when AB mode starts and the aircraft will continue to change the left / right ridge.
-Exit AB mode requires mode channel (CH 5) dial switch to GPS mode / attitude mode to exit AB mode (when AB dot channel (CH 6) is still in the point B position, it is recommended to restore to the default position). In order to re-record the AB point, click the clear AB point button in the APP manual job interface to clear the last AB point. At this time, the 2 flash light of the AB point goes out, indicating that the clearing is successful.
-After the current AB operation returns, if the AB break point is needed to fly, there is no need to know the AB point. Only after taking off in GPS mode, the mode channel (CH 5) switch is switched to AB mode, the aircraft automatically flies to the last breakpoint position to perform the operation.

# Live adjustment in AB mode during flight

1) Adjust the length of the ridge

 To adapt to the irregular plots, AB point length can be adjusted in real time by pitch rod during flight. Adjust the operation as follows:

-The extension of AB point: when the plane flies to the edge, push the pitch lever (push or pull, the far end is the push, the near section is the pull), the plane will slowly advance at the speed of 2 m/s, when the fast reaches the extension position, the pitch lever returns, the plane stops, and then start to copy the corresponding route, AB point extension is completed.

-Shortening of AB point: when the plane flies to the distance shortened position similar, push the pitch rod (push or pull, the far end to pull, the near section to push), the plane will slowly advance at the speed of 2 m/s, when the extended position, the pitch rod returns, the plane stops, and then start to copy the corresponding route, AB point shortened.

2) Adjust the height

During the flight, the middle throttle is fixed high flight (in the case of radar), the throttle is pushed, the height is up, the throttle down is down.

3) Adjust the direction

During the flight, the middle head locks the flight, and the left pushes the nose left, and the right pushes the nose right.

# AB mode continues to fly

 During the AB mode flight, when the current dose is low or low voltage, then the vehicle needs to fly the last AB point. Follow the following steps to fly.

Take-off manually, in GPS hover mode, mode channel (CH 5) dial switch to AB mode, then the aircraft enters AB mode breakpoint continue flight mode, fly up once AB mode exit, and then continue to perform AB operation.

# AB mode for obstacle avoidance

1) Manual obstacle avoidance

Aircraft in AB operation, when the front of obstacles, first dial the roll bar, the plane will enter the manual operation mode, and then to the direction of the roll rod, shift to safety offset, can pitch rod operation, bypass obstacles, and then all the pole position, the plane will automatically return to AB mode, and then for subsequent operations.

2) Automatic obstacle avoidance

If the aircraft is equipped with obstacle avoidance radar, when the radar detects obstacles in front / rear, the aircraft will automatically hover / detour according to the obstacle avoidance action set on the APP. If the choice is hovering, the plane will hover automatically when the obstacle, and then the remote control can directly enter the manual obstacle winding mode; if the choice is detour, the plane will shift to the side until there is no obstacle ahead, and then fly forward double the obstacle avoidance distance + 5 meters, as shown in the figure below:

#AB-T pattern

In order to facilitate the AB mode operation, the AB-T mode was added to the AB mode. You can adjust the Angle of the AB point during scheduling to change the aircraft route and adapt to more complex plots.

# AB-T operation process

-Re-click AB, click the clear AB point button in the APP manual operation interface to clear the last AB point information, and ensure that there is no AB point inside the aircraft (if AB point exists, the LED will have purple light flashing).
-Take off manually and fly to the first starting point. In GPS hover mode, the AB dot channel (CH 6) dial switch dials from standby to point A to record the coordinates of point A. After point A successful record, the APP will report point A successful record, and the LED light 1 violet light.
 After successful recording at point A, the in situ rotating nose is aimed at the other side except the AB direction. Click the AB Angle button to record the angle of point A.**
-The aircraft flies to the point B position, the water pump will automatically turn on during the flight, in the GPS hover mode AB dot channel (CH 6) dial switch from point A to point B record B point record record, LED light 2 flash light.
 After successful recording of- ** B, the in situ rotating nose is aimed at the other side except the AB direction. Click the AB Angle button to record the angle of point B.**
-After the recording is completed, the mode channel (CH 5) dial switch is switched to AB mode, and then the roll channel gives a left / right full bar action, when AB mode starts and the aircraft will continue to change the left / right ridge.
-Exit AB mode requires mode channel (CH 5) dial switch to GPS mode / attitude mode to exit AB mode (when AB dot channel (CH 6) is still in the point B position, it is recommended to restore to the default position). In order to re-record the AB point, click the clear AB point button in the APP manual job interface to clear the last AB point. At this time, the 2 flash light of the AB point goes out, indicating that the clearing is successful.
-After the current AB operation returns, if the AB break point is needed to fly, there is no need to know the AB point. Only after taking off in GPS mode, the mode channel (CH 5) switch is switched to AB mode, the aircraft automatically flies to the last breakpoint position to perform the operation.
