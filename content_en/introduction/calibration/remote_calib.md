 Check the rudder volume of each channel of the remote control according to the channel inspection page in the APP, and check whether the rudder volume of each channel of the remote control needs to be reversed. If the positive and negative definition of the channel is not consistent with the APP display, the reverse rudder quantity should be set in the reference software of the remote control. Check whether the rudder range of channel 1 \ ~4 is between (100,200), the rudder range of channel 5 \ ~8 is between (110,190), the channel error cannot exceed 3%, if over 3%, the APP will display red letters. Remote control calibration is required as follows:

-First, the positive and negative setting of each channel is complete and correct, the fine tuning of all joysticks on the remote control is zero, and all channel curves are set to default.
-Place the joystick and button switch (1 \ ~8 channel) to the median, click the remote control calibration button into the remote control calibration mode, the APP will remind all joystick and lever placed to the middle, click the confirmation button, the APP will broadcast the remote control calibration voice, the LED indicator is purple light 3 flash, said to enter the remote control calibration mode, and then push all the channels) corresponding to the joystick or dial key to the maximum working range and repeat several times.
-After completing the above operation, click the OK button on the APP interface to exit the remote control calibration mode. The LED light flashes normally (the purple light is out), and the calibration is completed.
