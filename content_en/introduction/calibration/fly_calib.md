## Flight Calibration

1)Voltage calibration

The power battery voltage detected by the flight control system may be slightly different from the actual voltage of the battery,At this point, need to do a voltage calibration
Fill in the real voltage of the battery in the real voltage of the flight calibration page, and click Calibration to complete the voltage calibration,

* Note: Only the voltage value with the displayed voltage ±5 can be filled in. If the voltage gap is too large, it cannot be calibrated. It is necessary to check the reason for the gap. *

2）Horizontal calibration
Since there may be some deviation between the mounting plane and the plane of the aircraft body, it is necessary to carry out horizontal calibration, otherwise the flight performance will be affected. Put the aircraft on a horizontal plane to ensure that the aircraft is basically level. At this time, if the attitude Angle of the aircraft has a deviation of more than 2 degrees, it needs to carry out horizontal calibration. Enter the advanced setting \> flight calibration \> confirm level. At this time, it will be found that the previous Angle deviation will be cleared and the level calibration will be completed. (* Factory will do horizontal calibration, generally do not need horizontal calibration *)
