To achieve accurate spraying, the V9-AG system provides flow meter calibration.

1. Flow meter calibration

Fill the medicine cabinet with water, such as the medicine cabinet for 10L, fill the water tank * * accurately * * to 10L. Enter the pump calibration page, the capacity of the medicine cabinet is filled in 10, the coefficient is 0, and then click the calibration flow meter, at this time the pump will automatically spray water, until the water in the water tank is sprayed, wait for the pump to automatically close, you can complete the calibration of the flow meter.
