 Select the type of ground to map:

* * Polygon plot * *: For the whole piece of the large field block, map the boundary of the plot, and then plan the route to operate in the plot.

* * Free route * *: For the needs of irregular spraying, such as spraying irregular fruit trees, the need to stay on the tree for spraying, etc.

 The APP supports * mobile phone / remote control / aircraft / RTK base station / dot / map * There are 6 plot mapping methods, among which * aircraft / RTK base station / dot * can support RTK high precision dot (optional RTK version).

The following takes is used as an example to describe how to carry out high-precision RTK plot mapping.

1) First enter the remote control Settings page, and then connect to Qianxun service;

# Route planning

After the plot mapping is completed, the plot needs to be edited to generate the route. The route editing mainly has the following attributes:

* * 1) Route generation * *

-Entering the automatic operation interface, the current account plot near the location will be displayed. The APP obtains the plots from the plant protection management platform through the network. If the network is not smooth and not successful, it can refresh the list again after the plot list. Where there is no network at all, the plots will be kept locally.
-In the plot list, select the plot that you want to work on. Click the next button to enter the plot planning.

-Select different edges (edge 1 / edge 2...), and the planned route will be parallel to the selected edges (orange label highlighted).
-Each edge can be set with a safe distance, and the safe distance can be set either by adding or subtracting buttons, or by entering numbers directly.
-Select the vertex of the plot as the starting point of the route. Touching the vertex of the plot, the ① navigation point is automatically planned near the vertex.
-If the route direction of the plot boundary is not meeting the operation, any Angle disk can be used to adjust the route Angle.
-Click the route type button, you can select the route type to be planned in the current plot, and you can plan the * bow route / winding route / fruit tree route / throwing route.*

* * Bow route: plan the bow route back and forth on the plot.**

* * Side route: a route around the edge of the plot for sweeping * *

* * Fruit tree route: For the whole row of fruit trees, you can make 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 at the end of one tree row, and 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 at the end of the other tree row. When planning the fruit tree route, you can automatically connect 1-8,2-7,3-6,4-5 into a line and plan the flight path.**

* * Drop route: For the cast model, a drop point can be planned every other distance.**

-Click the intelligent mileage button to set the maximum flight mileage of a single flight. After the setting, the route will be divided by planning the route, and the route will be completed at the starting point close to the starting point within the maximum flight mileage. The drone will perform hover / return operations, and the next flight will start the next route from near. This function is set reasonably to ensure that the route is close near the starting point, and the next flight will fly to the distance without a load. If the smart mileage is set to 0, turn off the smart planning function, as shown below:

-Click the safe distance button to set the safety boundary distance and the obstacle boundary safety distance. The boundary safe distance represents the shrinking distance within the route, and the obstacle boundary safe distance represents the extended distance outside the route near the obstacle.

* * 2) Delete some shipping points * *

In the process of actual operation, a plot may have several routes is not homework, can by deleting the point will not delete homework routes, specific operation is: click delete the route serial number icon, in the pop-up prompt box input delete the end of the route serial number, and then confirm, in the figure below:

* * 3) Set up the auxiliary take-off point landing point * *

If there is an obstacle between the take-off point and the flight point 1, or between the take-off point and the return point, the take-off / return flight can be set on the map. Operation: long press on the map, and a red triangle will be displayed on the map after 1 second, indicating that the setting of the auxiliary point has been successful. The auxiliary points need to be set up in advance, before the flight to the point and before the return flight. Re-upload the route or click the Clear secondary point button to clear the secondary point.

# Autonomous flight- -fruit tree mode

 Fruit tree mode is to measure the longitude, latitude, and altitude (relative height, altitude and altitude) of each tree by surveying the aircraft (or using the aircraft to dot), and plan it as a flight route. It can set whether the route is sprayed, and the hovering spraying time. Plot can also be surveyed in advance to generate usable routes and save them.cvs perhaps. Import the kml file into the APP for use.

1. Enter the mapping interface, select the free route to start clicking or select the import button in the upper right corner to import the generated navigation point file.
